# ReactStore and signal selector routing

Use this root for React-specific `themis` work when the touched app or
code path has React evidence: React components/hooks, JSX/TSX UI, imports from
`react`, `ReactStore` from `@augmentcode/themis/react-store`, or Preact React signal
selector consumption. Generic Redux/redux-saga guidance remains in `../core/`.

## React Store family rule

- A React app using this skill has chosen `ReactStore` and Preact React signal
  direct selector calls as the preferred component/custom-hook integration path.
  `.useValue(...args)` remains available only for necessary hook/plain-value fallbacks.
- Keep this app path on `ReactStore` and Preact React signal integration.

## React leaf routes

| Route | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `./signals/SKILL.md` | General Preact Signals guidance for ReactStore apps: `ReadonlySignal<T>`, `.value`, `computed`, Babel transform/`useSignals()` tracking, direct JSX signal rendering, component-local signal hooks, and avoiding module-level shared signal state. |
| `./store/SKILL.md` | Choosing/importing `ReactStore`, initialization/disposal, shared Store runtime behavior, or Store-family contrast. |
| `./selectors/SKILL.md` | Authoring selectors whose direct calls return cached `ReadonlySignal<R>` outputs, preferring direct signals in React consumers, using `.useValue(...args)` only for hook/plain-value fallback paths, plus `.withStore`, `.select`, and saga-only `.effect`. |
| `./component-integration/SKILL.md` | Wiring `ReactStore` into JSX/TSX React apps, bootstrap/root init and disposal ownership, app saga startup through `reactStore.runSaga(sagaFn)`, React component reads through direct signals first, and Store-first dispatch. |
| `./selector-lifecycle/SKILL.md` | Choosing React selector call modes across component render/custom hooks, direct signal-aware code, handlers/callbacks/tests, sagas, selector composition, and explicit `.withStore(...)` binding. |
| `./selector-scheduling/SKILL.md` | React `ReadonlySignal`/`.useValue(...args)` scheduling guidance: same source + selector + args output reuse, Store-owned selector coalescing, `throttledSelectorFrequency`, package-private scheduler boundaries, and no manual debounce/audit-log misuse. |
| `./migration/SKILL.md` | React migration/adoption work from local React state/context/hooks/effects/external stores to `ReactStore`, selectors, actions, reducers, sagas, signal-first component consumption, and cleanup. |

First-time app setup starts at the canonical root setup skill: `../setup/SKILL.md`.

## Routing rules

- Use `ReactStore` only from `@augmentcode/themis/react-store`.
- Create production app-local React selectors through the configured
  `ReactStore` instance: `reactStore.createSelector(...)`.
- Direct selector calls return `ReadonlySignal<R>` values and are the preferred
  React component/custom-hook integration path when consumers can accept signals.
- Components that read direct selector `.value` must rely on the Preact Signals
  Babel transform or an explicit `useSignals()` runtime fallback; passing or
  intentionally rendering signals in JSX is valid when the consumer is
  signal-aware.
- Use `.useValue(...args)` only when a React hook/plain value is necessary and adapting
  the consumer to accept a signal is impractical.
- Direct signal outputs and `.useValue(...args)` are throttled by
  `throttledSelectorFrequency`.
- Direct `ReadonlySignal` outputs are cached for the same ReactStore instance + selector + args; do not add memoize/cache/debounce/throttle wrappers for selector performance.
- Selector trace output is a default-off diagnostic; pass
  `{ traceSelectors: true }` only while diagnosing selector scheduling.
- `.effect(...args)` stays saga-only; it is not a hook or render subscription.
- `.select(state, ...args)` stays the pure selector path for tests/composition.
- React component, selector lifecycle, selector scheduling, and migration work must
  route to the React leaves above as operational guidance for this app.

Use the React leaves above for operational guidance. They cover component wiring,
selector call modes and scheduling, Store lifecycle, and migration in full.

## Verification cues

- Examples import package APIs only from public subpaths such as
  `@augmentcode/themis/react-store`, `@augmentcode/themis/saga`, and
  `@augmentcode/themis/types`.
- React guidance states that direct selector calls returning signals are preferred
  for React consumers, while `.useValue(...args)` returns plain `R` only as a necessary
  hook/plain-value fallback.
- Signal examples mention `.value` tracking through the Babel transform or
  explicit `useSignals()` and do not introduce module-level shared signal state.
- The app path uses `ReactStore` and Preact React signals consistently.
