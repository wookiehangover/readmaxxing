# File Structure & Registration

> Source: `@augmentcode/themis/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Slice File Structure + Store Initialization; `../SKILL.md` §9.

## Setup — slice directory layout

```
src/slices/{slice-name}/
  {slice-name}-types.ts          # Types, interfaces, enums (safe to import from any process)
  {slice-name}-slice.ts          # The only action/reducer owner module for this slice
  {slice-name}-selectors.ts      # The only selector owner module for this slice
  {slice-name}-slice.test.ts     # Reducer tests
  sagas/
    {slice-name}-saga.ts         # Saga logic
    {slice-name}-saga.test.ts    # Saga tests
```

Each slice directory owns exactly one `*-slice.ts` module and exactly one `*-selectors.ts` module. If a feature needs multiple logical slices, split them into sibling directories named after the slice owners instead of adding multiple slice or selectors files to one directory. Physical paths stay kebab-case, while the logical slice identity used in reducer-map keys and action namespaces is always camelCase (for example `src/slices/user-preferences/user-preferences-slice.ts` registers as `userPreferences` and emits `"userPreferences/updateTheme"`).

The top-level store lives at `src/store.ts` (or wherever you export your `Store` instance) and registers all slices. `@augmentcode/themis/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` shows the short form: `src/slices/<domain>/` with the same filenames.

## Core Patterns

### Register a normal slice

```typescript
// src/store.ts
import { Store } from '<selected Store family package>';
import type { StoreState } from '@augmentcode/themis/types';
import { mySliceReducer } from './slices/my-slice/my-slice-slice';
import { mySliceSaga } from './slices/my-slice/sagas/my-slice-saga';

export const store = new Store({ mySlice: mySliceReducer });
export type AppState = StoreState<typeof store>;
```

Use `StoreState<typeof store>` for app state typing after constructing the store with app reducer maps. Constructor reducer maps preserve reducer-state inference without an explicit `: Store` annotation. Register only app-owned reducers. `Store` manages package-owned internals automatically under reserved `@internal_` names: internal reducers such as `@internal_storeUtility` are always package-managed, and the internal saga manager starts during `Store` initialization. Do not add app reducers/sagas with that prefix or couple selectors/tests to the internal state shape.

Then in the application's selected Store family root lifecycle, initialize the
store and start each app saga explicitly by function. Use the selected Store
family skill for component/runtime lifecycle details; core owns the file layout,
saga registration, and reducer ownership rules.

`store.init()` combines the registered reducers, creates the Redux store with middleware, lets the concrete Store variant create its selector state resources, and starts the package saga manager. It does **not** start app sagas — start each one with `store.runSaga(sagaFn)` from the family-appropriate root lifecycle, or imperatively and keep the returned cancel function. It derives the manager name from the saga function and rejects direct `@internal_sagaManager` usage. Register the `store.init()` disposer with the selected Store family lifecycle cleanup; that disposer delegates to `store.dispose()`, which tears down the initialized Store runtime and stops Store-owned saga tasks when the whole Store lifetime ends.

### Saga-only slice (no state, no reducer)

Some slices exist only to define saga trigger actions with no meaningful state. Keep the action creators and saga but **do not register a reducer**.

```typescript
// src/slices/triggers/triggers-slice.ts
import { createAction } from '@augmentcode/themis/utils/store/create-action';

export const rescanWorkspace = createAction('triggers/rescanWorkspace');
```

```typescript
// src/slices/triggers/sagas/triggers-saga.ts
import { takeEvery, call } from 'typed-redux-saga';
import { rescanWorkspace } from '../triggers-slice';

export function* triggersSaga() {
  yield* takeEvery(rescanWorkspace, function* () {
    yield* call(rescan);
  });
}
```

```typescript
// src/store.ts
export const store = new Store({}); // no reducer map entry; start with store.runSaga(triggersSaga)
```

### Naming conventions

- **Type definitions:** `{slice-name}-types.ts` — all types, interfaces, enums
- **State type:** `{Feature}State` (e.g., `NotificationsState`) — defined in `-types.ts`
- **Reducer:** `{feature}Reducer` (e.g., `notificationsReducer`)
- **Actions:** verb phrases (e.g., `addNotification`, `fetchItems`)
- **Selectors:** `select` prefix (e.g., `selectNotifications`, `selectIsLoading`)
- **Logical slice identity:** camelCase reducer-map keys and action namespaces (e.g., `userPreferences`)
- **Action types:** `"sliceName/actionName"` with camelCase `sliceName` (e.g., `"userPreferences/updateTheme"`)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Registering a reducer for a saga-only slice

Empty reducers add state-tree noise and run on every action; saga-only slices define trigger actions without state.

```typescript
// WRONG
export const noopReducer = createReducer({}).build();
export const store = new Store({ triggers: noopReducer });
```

```typescript
// CORRECT — no reducer map entry; start the saga with store.runSaga(triggersSaga)
export const store = new Store({});
```

### ❌ Adding multiple slice or selectors owner files to one directory

One directory means one logical slice owner. Multiple owners make reducer keys, action namespaces, and selector ownership ambiguous.

```text
// WRONG — two logical slices in one directory
src/slices/settings/profile-slice.ts
src/slices/settings/profile-selectors.ts
src/slices/settings/theme-slice.ts
src/slices/settings/theme-selectors.ts
```

```text
// CORRECT — split by slice owner
src/slices/profile/profile-slice.ts
src/slices/profile/profile-selectors.ts
src/slices/theme/theme-slice.ts
src/slices/theme/theme-selectors.ts
```

Source: `../SKILL.md` §9 (File structure) · **Priority: HIGH**

### ❌ Using kebab-case or snake_case as the logical slice identity

File and directory names may be kebab-case, but reducer-map keys and action namespaces must be camelCase.

```typescript
// WRONG
export const updateTheme = createAction("user-preferences/updateTheme");
export const store = new Store({ "user-preferences": userPreferencesReducer });
```

```typescript
// CORRECT
export const updateTheme = createAction("userPreferences/updateTheme");
export const store = new Store({ userPreferences: userPreferencesReducer });
```

Source: `../SKILL.md` §9 (Naming) · **Priority: HIGH**

### ❌ Naming selectors without the `select` prefix

Breaks the `.select` / `.effect` lookup convention used across the codebase and tests; reviewers cannot tell a selector from a plain function.

```typescript
// WRONG
export const isLoading = store.createSelector(...);
```

```typescript
// CORRECT
export const selectIsLoading = store.createSelector(...);
```

Source: `../SKILL.md` §9 (Naming) · **Priority: MEDIUM**

### ❌ Defining state types inline in `{slice-name}-slice.ts`

Cross-process imports (e.g. Electron preload) pull in the reducer and action-creator factories just to get types; always put types in `{slice-name}-types.ts`.

```typescript
// WRONG — feature-slice.ts
export type FeatureState = { items: Collection<Item, 'id'> };
export const featureReducer = createReducer<FeatureState>(...);
```

```typescript
// CORRECT — feature-types.ts
export type FeatureState = { items: Collection<Item, 'id'> };

// feature-slice.ts
import type { FeatureState } from './feature-types';
```
